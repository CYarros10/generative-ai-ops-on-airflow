# Vertex AI LLMops on Airflow
Step-by-step lab/guide to getting started with Google Vertex AI LLMops on Apache Airflow.

## What is LLMops?

LLMOps, or large language model operations, refers to the practices and processes involved in managing and operating large language models (LLMs). LLMs are artificial intelligence (AI) models trained on vast datasets of text and code, enabling them to perform various language-related tasks, such as text generation, translation, and question answering.

LLMOps involves a comprehensive set of activities, including:

- Model deployment and maintenance: deploying and managing LLMs on cloud platforms or on-premises infrastructure
- Data management: curating and preparing training data, as well as monitoring and maintaining data quality
- Model training and fine-tuning: training and refining LLMs to improve their performance on specific tasks
- Monitoring and evaluation: tracking LLM performance, identifying errors, and optimizing models
- Security and compliance: ensuring the security and regulatory compliance of LLM operations

LLMOps involves a number of different steps, including:

- Data collection and preparation: LLMs require large amounts of data to train. This data must be collected and prepared in a way that is suitable for training the model.
- Model development: LLMs are developed using a variety of techniques, including unsupervised learning, supervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
- Model deployment: Once a LLM has been developed, it must be deployed to a production environment. This involves setting up the necessary infrastructure and configuring the model to run on a specific platform.
- Model management: LLMs require ongoing management to ensure that they are performing as expected. This includes monitoring the model's performance, retraining the model as needed, and making sure that the model is secure.
